For Training: Google Cloud gives free limited credit to students.

ReadingNN Repo

A Machine Learning project designed to learn and recognize numbers from pictures and videos.

Welcome!

Things to Research:

Textbook: http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/

Tensorflow Similar Project: https://js.tensorflow.org/tutorials/mnist.html

If any of you are unfamiliar with Python, you will need to research it. I would suggest Udemy's Complete Python Bootcamp ($11).

Neural Network Libraries

- OpenCV

- Flask

- Python IDEs

Data Set: Possibly http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/

Two Demos
------------
1. App Demo: A python based demo built on Kivyâ€™s gui language. It accepts handwritten letters and digits from the user and displays the 1st and 2nd  best predictions of the number/ letter.

2. Desktop Demo: An Android app (built using android studio) that uses trained model to make predictions on handwritten digits on-screen. In addition, it recognizes handwritten characters in real-time using camera.
